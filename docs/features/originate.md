# Call Origination

Analagous to `WebSIP` this feature allows the user to comfortably dial an extension from the frontend.
But in this case the call is originated from a physical telephone selectable from a drop-down menu.

## Process
1. Click on an extension in the phonebook
2. Select a phone to send the call to
3. The selected phone will ring
4. After pickup, the target phone will ring
5. Profit!
