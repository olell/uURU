# µURU - Pages

You can create custom help / info or other markdown pages by putting markdown
files called as you want your pages to be called in the `pages/` directory.

If pages are enabled and µURU can find at least one markdown (.md) file in the
`pages/` directory, a dropdown offering access to those pages will appear in the
navbar.

You can set the title of the dropdown button in the navbar by using the `PAGES_TITLE`
configuration. All markdown files will be visible in the dropdown, for any user
wether they're logged in or anonymous.
