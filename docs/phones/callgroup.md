# Callgroups

## Enable flavor

Add `callgroup` to the list of enabled flavors in your config to enable the
callgroup feature.

## Use Callgroups

You can add callgroups as any other extension in the webapp, the participants
of the callgroup are expressed as a comma-seperated list of the extensions.

Normal users may only create callgroups with extensions they've created. Admin
users can create callgroups from any extension.
